    ROUND(AVG(churn_probability), 2) as avg_risk_score,
    SUM(CASE WHEN churn_probability > 0.6 THEN MonthlyCharges ELSE 0 END) as monthly_revenue_at_risk
FROM customer_predictions 
GROUP BY Contract
ORDER BY avg_risk_score DESC;

-- Customer segmentation by service usage
SELECT 
    InternetService,
    COUNT(*) as customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN TotalCharges ELSE 0 END) as lost_revenue,
